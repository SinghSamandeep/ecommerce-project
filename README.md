# E-commerce Watch Store

Welcome to the E-commerce Watch Store project, an innovative platform built using Vue 3, Node.js, and Spring Boot, designed to offer a comprehensive shopping experience for watch enthusiasts. The application architecture is segmented into four core components: client frontend, client backend, admin frontend, and admin backend, utilizing MySQL and MongoDB for robust data management.
